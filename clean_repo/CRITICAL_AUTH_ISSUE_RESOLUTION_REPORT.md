# CRITICAL AUTHENTICATION ISSUE - RESOLVED

**Date:** 2025-09-09 16:56:08  
**Status:** âœ… RESOLVED  
**Severity:** CRITICAL  
**Resolution Time:** Immediate  

## Issue Summary

The admin credentials (ez@aiworkify.com / 12345678) that had been working throughout the entire development process suddenly showed "Invalid login credentials" error, preventing access to the AI GYM platform.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Issue: Password Hash Mismatch
The investigation revealed that the authentication system uses Supabase's built-in auth system (`supabase.auth.signInWithPassword`), but there was a mismatch between:
- The password hash stored in `auth.users.encrypted_password`
- The expected password "12345678"

### Technical Details
- **Auth User Record**: Present and confirmed (ID: 39da584e-99a5-4a9b-a8ac-9122bbee9e92)
- **Admin Record**: Properly linked with same ID and super_admin role
- **Issue**: Password hash in auth.users table did not match "12345678"

## Resolution Process

### 1. Database Investigation âœ…
- Verified admin account exists in auth.users table
- Confirmed admin record properly linked in admins table
- Identified password hash mismatch as root cause

### 2. Password Reset âœ…
```sql
UPDATE auth.users 
SET encrypted_password = crypt('12345678', gen_salt('bf', 10)) 
WHERE email = 'ez@aiworkify.com';
```

### 3. Authentication Verification âœ…
- Tested login flow on deployed application
- Confirmed successful authentication
- Verified admin privileges properly granted
- Validated dashboard access

### 4. Feature Access Verification âœ…
- Training Zone: Full access confirmed
- WOD Builder: Complete functionality verified
- Section Header Feature: Working perfectly

## Verified Working Credentials

**âœ… CONFIRMED WORKING:**

## System Status
