# WOD Builder Testing Report

## Executive Summary

During this testing session, I attempted to access and test the WOD Builder functionality on the AI GYM platform (https://o06xpgu7o9vx.space.minimax.io). However, **access to the WOD Builder and most platform features requires admin privileges**, which are not available through the standard test account creation process.

## Testing Process

### 1. Authentication Setup
- Successfully created test account using the platform's test account generator
- **Test Credentials Generated:**
  - Email: `hkjoghnf@minimax.com`
  - Password: `FFIIZENb0R`
  - User ID: `dac66d92-9d19-4167-9f23-fa3505b551e6`
- Successfully logged into the platform

### 2. Navigation Attempts

I systematically attempted to access WOD Builder through multiple pathways:

#### Dashboard Access ✅
- Successfully accessed the main Analytics Dashboard
- Confirmed user authentication and basic platform access

#### Navigation Menu Testing ❌
All major navigation sections returned "Access Denied" messages:

1. **Training Zone** (`/training-zone`) - Access Denied
2. **Content > Documents** (`/content/documents`) - Access Denied  
3. **Users** (`/users`) - Access Denied
4. **Communitys** (`/communitys`) - Access Denied
5. **Tags** (`/tags`) - Access Denied

#### Direct URL Access ❌
- Attempted direct access to `/wod-builder` - Access Denied

## Console Log Analysis

The browser console logs revealed the core issue:

```
✅ User authenticated, fetching admin data...
❌ Admin fetch failed with exception: Error: Admin data fetch timeout
❌ Access denied - user is not an admin
❌ No admin data found for user (user is regular user)
```

**Key Finding:** The platform architecture requires admin privileges for accessing WOD Builder and most content management features.

## Current Interface State

### Accessible Areas
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Functional with basic metrics display
- **Authentication System**: Working properly
- **Navigation Interface**: Visual elements load correctly

### Non-Accessible Areas (Admin Required)
- WOD Builder functionality
- Content management systems
- User management
- Community management  
- Training zone features
- Tag management

## Testing Limitations Identified

### 1. Permission Barrier
- **Issue**: WOD Builder requires admin-level access
- **Impact**: Cannot test the requested Section Header block functionality
- **User Account Type**: Standard user (non-admin)

### 2. Testing Scope Restrictions
- Cannot test text input field behavior in right panel
- Cannot verify template text refill issues
- Cannot assess real-time editing problems
- Cannot document editing interface behavior

## Recommendations

### For Continued Testing
1. **Admin Account Required**: Obtain admin-level credentials to access WOD Builder
2. **Alternative Access**: Check if there's a different authentication method for testing
3. **Developer Access**: Contact platform administrators for testing privileges

### For Platform Development
1. **Testing Environment**: Consider creating a demo/sandbox mode for functional testing
2. **Permission Documentation**: Clearly document which features require admin access
3. **User Experience**: Consider graduated access levels for different user types

## Technical Details

### Platform Information
- **URL**: https://o06xpgu7o9vx.space.minimax.io
- **Authentication System**: Functional (Supabase-based)
- **User Management**: Role-based access control implemented
- **Framework**: Modern web application with real-time authentication

### Error Patterns
- Consistent "Access Denied" messages across protected routes
- Proper error handling and user feedback
- Clean redirect mechanisms for unauthorized access

## Conclusion

**Testing Status**: Blocked due to insufficient privileges

The WOD Builder testing cannot be completed with the current user account permissions. While the platform's authentication system and basic navigation work correctly, the core functionality requires administrative access that is not available through standard test account creation.

**Next Steps Required**: Admin-level access or alternative testing credentials needed to proceed with the requested Section Header block testing and editing behavior analysis.
