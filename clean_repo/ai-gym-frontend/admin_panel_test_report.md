# Admin Panel Testing Report - Content Repository > Videos Section

## Test Summary
**URL**: https://nwe6v196kzjs.space.minimax.io  
**Test Date**: 2025-08-26 01:25:34  
**Test Objective**: Navigate to admin panel, access Content Repository > Videos section, and verify interface loading without infinite loading issues.

## Critical Issue Identified

### Infinite Loading Problem
**Status**: ❌ **FAILED - Blocking Issue**

The website exhibits a persistent infinite loading state that prevents access to any functional interface, including the admin panel and Content Repository > Videos section.

#### Detailed Findings:
1. **Initial Page Load**: Upon navigation to the website, the page displays only a loading spinner
2. **Loading Duration**: Page remained in loading state for extended period (several minutes)
3. **Page Refresh Test**: Refreshing the page did not resolve the issue - same infinite loading persists
4. **Console Analysis**: No JavaScript errors or failed API responses detected in browser console
5. **Interactive Elements**: Only one div element detected, with no functional navigation or content areas

#### Visual Evidence:
- Screenshot 1: `after_loading_wait.png` - Shows initial loading state
- Screenshot 2: `after_click_attempt.png` - Shows persistence after interaction attempt  
- Screenshot 3: `after_refresh.png` - Shows continuation of loading state after page refresh

## Impact Assessment

### Cannot Test Required Functionality:
- ❌ Admin panel access - **BLOCKED**
- ❌ Content Repository navigation - **BLOCKED**  
- ❌ Videos section interface - **BLOCKED**
- ❌ List view functionality - **BLOCKED**
- ❌ Editing interface - **BLOCKED**

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required:
1. **Backend Investigation**: Check server logs for application startup issues or database connection problems
2. **API Response Verification**: Ensure all required API endpoints are responding correctly
3. **Frontend Bundle Analysis**: Verify JavaScript bundle is loading and executing properly
4. **Network Infrastructure**: Check if there are any network connectivity issues affecting asset loading

### Technical Investigation Areas:
- Review application server status and health checks
- Verify database connectivity and query performance
- Check for any deployment or configuration issues
- Analyze browser network tab for failed resource loads
- Review application initialization sequence

## Test Conclusion

**Overall Status**: ❌ **CRITICAL FAILURE**

The infinite loading issue is a blocking problem that prevents any meaningful testing of the admin panel's Content Repository > Videos section. The website is currently non-functional and requires immediate technical intervention before any interface testing can be performed.

**Next Steps**: Address the loading issue before attempting to test the admin panel functionality. Once resolved, a follow-up test should be conducted to verify proper loading and functionality of the Content Repository > Videos interface.
