2. **Documents Section** - Complete rebuild of content management interface
3. **Prompts Section** - Complete rebuild of content management interface
4. **Automations Section** - Complete rebuild of content management interface

### Investigation Needed:

- Database connectivity for content repositories
- API endpoint functionality for non-AI Agent sections

### Maintain Current State (LOW Priority):
- AI Agents section (functional and well-designed)
- Dashboard and analytics (working properly)
- Authentication system (operational)
- Navigation structure (complete)

## Visual Evidence Captured

1. **Login Interface** - Demo credentials and authentication flow
2. **Analytics Dashboard** - KPI display and filtering options
3. **Content Repositories Dropdown** - All available sections visible
4. **AI Agents Interface** - Functional empty state with creation options
5. **Loading States** - Consistent loading issues across multiple sections

## Conclusion

The AI GYM Platform has a solid foundation with working authentication, navigation, and dashboard systems. However, 80% of the content management functionality (4 out of 5 sections) requires complete rebuilding due to loading failures. The AI Agents section serves as a good template for the user interface design and functionality patterns that should be replicated across other content types.

**Overall Platform Status:** ðŸŸ¡ Partially Functional - Core systems work, but primary content features need rebuilding.
