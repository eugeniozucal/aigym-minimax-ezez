   - Course enrollment API  
   - Courses API
2. **Database Connection**: Verify Supabase Edge Function configurations
3. **Content Population**: Once APIs are fixed, populate course catalog with test data

### Development Priorities
1. Fix backend service reliability
2. Add error handling and fallback mechanisms
3. Implement loading states for better UX during API calls
4. Consider caching mechanisms for improved performance

## üìä Overall Assessment

**Platform Status**: **FRONTEND EXCELLENT, BACKEND NEEDS ATTENTION**

The AI GYM platform demonstrates professional-grade frontend development with excellent user experience design. The platform architecture is sound with proper security measures. The primary blocker is backend service reliability, which once resolved, will reveal a fully functional comprehensive learning management system with advanced features including WODs, content creation tools, and user management capabilities.

**Confidence Level**: High - The platform foundation is solid and functional issues appear to be isolated to backend services rather than fundamental design problems.
