3. **Priority 3**: Investigate console timeout errors that may be related

### Technical Investigation Needed
1. Review Section Header element code for bugs
2. Check server-side handling of Section Header creation requests
3. Investigate admin data fetch timeouts that appear in console
4. Test all other BASIC ELEMENTS for similar issues

### Testing Recommendations
1. Implement automated testing for all WOD Builder elements
2. Add specific error logging for element creation failures
