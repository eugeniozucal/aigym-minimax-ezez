Despite the URL path `/static/js` strongly implying that this location should serve static JavaScript files or be a directory listing, the actual content of the page is an HTML response. This response does not contain any embedded JavaScript or CSS code, nor does it link to any external static files (JS or CSS), nor is it a directory listing. Therefore, this specific page does not directly reveal static file structure, beyond the implication of its URL path.",
