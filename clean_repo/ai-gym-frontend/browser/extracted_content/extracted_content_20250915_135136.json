  "summary": "The page content unequivocally confirms that this is an 'Achievement Management' interface within the AI Gym Admin Portal. It is dedicated to managing achievement badges, milestones, and gamification rewards, and clearly not general content management. The page features tools to create new achievements, view a summary of achievements by tier (Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond), and a detailed table listing 38 individual achievements with specific types such as Completion, Streak, Mastery, Social, and Special. The navigation sidebar further reinforces this distinction by listing 'Achievements' separately from 'Content' and 'Videos'.",
