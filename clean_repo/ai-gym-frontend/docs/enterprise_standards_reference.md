## 1. Development Methodologies and Practices

### 1.1 Clean Architecture Implementation

**Core Principles:**
- **Dependency Rule**: Source code dependencies point inward toward higher-level policies
- **Business Logic Isolation**: Domain logic remains independent from infrastructure concerns
- **Framework Independence**: Core business rules unaffected by external system changes

**Layered Architecture Standards:**
```
Domain Model Layer (Core)
├── Business entities and rules
├── Plain Old Class Objects (POCOs) only
└── No infrastructure dependencies

Application Layer (Orchestration)
├── Coordinates tasks and workflows
├── Delegates work to domain objects
└── Thin layer focused on orchestration

Infrastructure Layer (External)
├── Data persistence and external integrations
├── Maintains clear boundaries with domain logic
└── Depends only on Domain layer
```

### 1.2 SOLID Principles Implementation

**Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
- Each class has only one reason to change
- Identify responsibilities by asking "What would cause this class to change?"
- Extract distinct responsibilities into separate components

**Open-Closed Principle (OCP)**
- Software entities open for extension, closed for modification
- Use interfaces and abstract classes as extension points
- Implement new features through composition rather than modification

**Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
- Subclasses must be substitutable for their parent classes
- Maintain robust and predictable inheritance hierarchies

**Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
- Break large interfaces into smaller, specific ones
- Components depend only on methods they actually use

**Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules
- Both should depend on abstractions
- Enables loose coupling and testability

### 1.3 Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Patterns

**Strategic DDD:**
- **Bounded Contexts**: Independent problem areas correlating to services
- **Ubiquitous Language**: Common vocabulary between technical and business teams
- **Context Mapping**: Clear relationships between bounded contexts

**Tactical DDD Patterns:**
- **Entities**: Objects with distinct identity that persists over time
- **Value Objects**: Descriptive aspects without conceptual identity (immutable)
- **Aggregates**: Clusters of related domain objects treated as single unit
- **Aggregate Roots**: Single entry point maintaining business invariants
- **Repositories**: Abstraction layer for data access
- **Domain Services**: Business operations not belonging to single entity

### 1.4 Code Quality Standards

**Code Review Requirements:**
- **Review Scope**: 200-400 lines of code per review for optimal effectiveness
- **Review Duration**: 60-90 minutes maximum per session
- **Inspection Rate**: Under 500 LOC per hour to maintain 70-90% defect discovery
- **Pre-Review Preparation**: Code annotation required to guide reviewers

**Quality Metrics:**
- **Test Coverage**: 90% minimum across all code paths
- **Critical Path Coverage**: 100% for authentication, data access, AI conversations
- **Branch Coverage**: 85% minimum for complex business logic
- **Documentation**: All public APIs and complex algorithms documented

**Code Style Standards:**
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode enabled with comprehensive type definitions
- **ESLint**: Enterprise configuration with security and performance rules
- **Prettier**: Consistent formatting across all codebases
- **Naming Conventions**: Descriptive names following domain terminology
