# AI GYM Components Inventory Research Plan

## Objective
Create comprehensive inventory of AI GYM components, distinguishing working vs broken components across 7 critical categories, with detailed preservation plan for working components.

## Task Complexity: COMPLEX
This requires systematic analysis across multiple system layers with detailed component-level assessment.

## Research Categories

### 1. Database Components and Data Integrity
- [x] 1.1 Examine Supabase database schema and tables
- [x] 1.2 Test database connectivity and access patterns  
- [x] 1.3 Verify data integrity constraints and relationships
- [x] 1.4 Check for working vs broken database operations

### 2. Supabase Backend Services  
- [x] 2.1 Analyze Supabase configuration and connection status
- [x] 2.2 Test real-time subscriptions and triggers
- [x] 2.3 Verify storage bucket functionality
- [x] 2.4 Assess RLS (Row Level Security) policies

### 3. Edge Functions Status
- [x] 3.1 Inventory all Supabase Edge functions
- [x] 3.2 Test function deployment and execution status
- [x] 3.3 Verify function integrations with main application
- [x] 3.4 Check function error handling and logging

### 4. Frontend Components That Render Correctly
- [x] 4.1 Examine React component structure and status
- [x] 4.2 Test component rendering and UI functionality
- [x] 4.3 Identify working vs broken UI elements
- [x] 4.4 Assess component dependencies and imports

### 5. API Endpoints That Function
- [x] 5.1 Map all API endpoints in the application
- [x] 5.2 Test endpoint connectivity and response status
- [x] 5.3 Verify request/response data integrity
- [x] 5.4 Document working vs failing endpoints

### 6. Authentication Backend vs Frontend
- [x] 6.1 Analyze Supabase Auth backend functionality
- [x] 6.2 Test authentication flow components
- [x] 6.3 Verify session management and token handling
- [x] 6.4 Compare backend vs frontend auth state consistency

### 7. Working vs Broken User Flows
- [x] 7.1 Map complete user journey paths
- [x] 7.2 Test critical user flow functionality
- [x] 7.3 Identify broken navigation and interaction patterns
- [x] 7.4 Document user experience impact

## Research Methods
- Source code analysis
- Configuration file examination  
- Database schema inspection
- Component testing and interaction
- API endpoint testing
- User flow simulation

## Expected Deliverables
1. Comprehensive component inventory by category
2. Working vs broken component classification
3. Root cause analysis for broken components
4. Detailed preservation plan for working components
5. Prioritized remediation roadmap

## Success Criteria
- Complete inventory of all 7 component categories
- Clear classification of functional status
- Actionable preservation and repair strategies
- Evidence-based conclusions with supporting data
