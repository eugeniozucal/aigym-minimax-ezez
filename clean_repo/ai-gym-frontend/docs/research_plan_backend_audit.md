# AI Gym Platform Backend Audit Research Plan

## Objective
Conduct a comprehensive audit of the current Supabase backend setup for the AI Gym Platform admin panel, identifying gaps and misconfigurations compared to what a fully functional system would require.

## Research Tasks

### 1. Database Schema Analysis
- [x] 1.1 Examine all table definitions in `/workspace/supabase/tables/`
- [x] 1.2 Analyze table relationships and data integrity constraints
- [x] 1.3 Assess migration history in `/workspace/supabase/migrations/`
- [x] 1.4 Identify missing tables for a complete AI Gym Platform

### 2. Row Level Security (RLS) Policies Audit
- [x] 2.1 Review existing RLS policies across all tables
- [x] 2.2 Identify security gaps and missing policies
- [x] 2.3 Assess policy effectiveness for admin vs user access
- [x] 2.4 Check for proper data isolation

### 3. Edge Functions Assessment
- [x] 3.1 Catalog all existing edge functions in `/workspace/supabase/functions/`
- [x] 3.2 Analyze function purposes and implementation quality
- [x] 3.3 Identify missing API endpoints for admin functionality
- [x] 3.4 Review error handling and security practices

### 4. Data Integrity and Validation
- [x] 4.1 Check for proper data validation mechanisms
- [x] 4.2 Assess foreign key relationships and constraints
- [x] 4.3 Review indexing strategy for performance
- [x] 4.4 Identify potential data consistency issues

### 5. Admin Panel Requirements Gap Analysis
- [x] 5.1 Define expected admin panel functionality
- [x] 5.2 Map current backend capabilities to admin requirements
- [x] 5.3 Identify missing backend support for admin features
- [x] 5.4 Assess scalability and performance considerations

### 6. Testing and Monitoring Infrastructure
- [x] 6.1 Review existing test suites in `/workspace/supabase/tests/`
- [x] 6.2 Assess monitoring and observability setup
- [x] 6.3 Check for proper backup and recovery mechanisms
- [x] 6.4 Evaluate CI/CD integration

### 7. Final Report Generation
- [x] 7.1 Compile comprehensive audit findings
- [x] 7.2 Prioritize identified issues and gaps
- [x] 7.3 Provide specific recommendations for improvements
- [x] 7.4 Create implementation roadmap for missing components
