# Research Plan: Broken Deployment Analysis

## Objective
Analyze the broken deployment at https://zxo7sh7kkhjz.space.minimax.io and document all non-functional features, missing admin capabilities, and UI/UX issues compared to the expected working version.

## Research Tasks

### Phase 1: Initial Assessment
- [x] 1.1 Access the website and document first impressions
- [x] 1.2 Test basic navigation and page loading
- [x] 1.3 Identify the type of application (e.g., admin dashboard, e-commerce, blog, etc.)
- [x] 1.4 Document overall structure and layout

**Phase 1 Results:** Website redirects to login page for "AI GYM - Training Zone Access Portal". No obvious technical issues found. Need to investigate further to identify what might be broken.

### Phase 2: Feature Analysis
- [x] 2.1 Test all visible interactive elements (buttons, forms, links)
- [x] 2.2 Check login/authentication functionality
- [x] 2.3 Test data loading and display
- [x] 2.4 Check responsive design and mobile compatibility
- [x] 2.5 Identify broken API calls or network errors

**Phase 2 Results:** Major issues found:
- Persistent loading spinners across multiple pages
- 404 errors on form submissions
- Admin paths redirect incorrectly (/admin â†’ /robots.txt)
- Backend connectivity problems
- Inconsistent domain/subdomain usage

### Phase 3: Admin Capabilities Assessment
- [x] 3.1 Identify admin-specific features that should exist
- [x] 3.2 Test admin authentication if accessible
- [x] 3.3 Check content management capabilities
- [x] 3.4 Verify user management functions
- [x] 3.5 Test data export/import features

**Phase 3 Results:** Admin capabilities completely non-functional:
- /admin redirects to /robots.txt with 404
- No accessible admin interface
- All management features inaccessible

### Phase 4: UI/UX Issues Documentation
- [x] 4.1 Document visual inconsistencies
- [x] 4.2 Identify broken styling or CSS issues
- [x] 4.3 Check for missing images or assets
- [x] 4.4 Test user workflow interruptions
- [x] 4.5 Document accessibility issues

**Phase 4 Results:** Major UX problems identified:
- Persistent loading spinners indicating failed content loading
- Complete workflow interruption - no functional user journeys
- 404 error pages as only accessible content

### Phase 5: Technical Analysis
- [x] 5.1 Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- [x] 5.2 Analyze network requests and failed calls
- [x] 5.3 Identify missing dependencies or resources
- [x] 5.4 Document performance issues

**Phase 5 Results:** Critical technical failures:
- Authentication system partially initialized but inaccessible
- All API endpoints return 404
- Backend connectivity completely broken
- Page title suggests video-related issues ("ai-gym-platform-video-fix")

### Phase 6: Report Generation
- [x] 6.1 Compile all findings into comprehensive analysis
- [x] 6.2 Categorize issues by severity and type
- [x] 6.3 Provide recommendations for fixes
- [x] 6.4 Create final report in docs/broken_state_analysis.md

**Phase 6 Complete:** Comprehensive analysis report created with:
- Complete application failure documentation
- Categorized issues by severity (Critical/High/Medium)
- Detailed technical analysis and recommendations
- Video-related problem identification
- Admin capability assessment
- UI/UX issue documentation

## Expected Deliverables
- Comprehensive analysis document with categorized issues
- Screenshots of broken features (if applicable)
- Technical error logs and console outputs
- Prioritized list of fixes needed
