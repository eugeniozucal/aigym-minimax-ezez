{"extracted_information": "Supabase offers a Postgres-based backend stack with various security features for enterprise use. It leverages PostgreSQL's native access control. Authentication is built on GoTrue, providing multiple methods and enterprise integrations. APIs have built-in access control and monitoring. Data is encrypted in transit and at rest. While Supabase itself is not SOC 2 or ISO/IEC 27001 certified, it runs on certified infrastructure (AWS, GCP) and offers self-hosting for greater compliance flexibility.
