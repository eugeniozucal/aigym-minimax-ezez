A balanced strategy includes a wide base of fast unit tests, a layer of integration tests, and a capstone of critical E2E tests. Lower-level tests catch most bugs early, but E2E tests are crucial for verifying system-wide functionality in production-like scenarios.

Run tests in parallel for speed. A reliable, optimized suite acts as a powerful safety net."}, {"practice": "Use Production-Like Test Environments", "description": "Replicate production environment closely (environment parity: same database types, similar scaling, configurations).
