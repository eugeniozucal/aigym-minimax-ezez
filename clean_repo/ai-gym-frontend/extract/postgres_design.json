Typically normalized up to 3NF or BCNF. Reduces data duplication and errors. Denormalization (merging tables) can optimize performance for read-heavy applications by reducing JOIN operations, but may increase data duplication and update complexity. It's a trade-off based on application needs."}, {"name": "Effective Indexing", "description": "Improves data retrieval speed by avoiding full table scans. Improves read performance but can slow down write operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) as indexes need updates. Focus on indexing columns used in WHERE clauses, JOIN conditions, and ORDER BY operations. Specific strategies include partial indexes (indexing a subset of rows), BRIN indexes (for large datasets with natural range order, e.g., time-series data), and unique indexes (for uniqueness and improved lookup performance, e.g., email addresses)."}, {"name": "Table Partitioning", "description": "Divides large tables into smaller, more manageable chunks to improve query performance (by limiting scan scope) and make database maintenance more efficient. PostgreSQL supports three types: range partitioning (for time-series data, e.g., logging), list partitioning (for categorical data), and hash partitioning (distributes data evenly for load balancing)."}, {"name": "Foreign Keys and Constraints", "description": "Ensures data integrity and consistency between related tables (foreign keys). Prevents orphaned records. CHECK constraints validate data before insertion (e.g., age cannot be <0 or >150). While improving data quality, constraints can introduce performance overhead in high-write environments, requiring a balance with use case requirements."}, {"name": "Query Optimization Techniques", "description": "Optimizes query execution to minimize resource consumption. Use EXPLAIN ANALYZE to generate execution plans and identify optimization areas (optimizing joins, minimizing subqueries, effective index use). Avoid N+1 query problems by using efficient JOIN operations and retrieving data in single, optimized queries."}, {"name": "Connection Pooling", "description": "Reduces overhead of establishing new database connections, which can be time-consuming. Connection poolers (e.g., PgBouncer, PgPool) reuse existing connections, reducing latency and improving scalability by limiting concurrent connections managed by the server. Allows higher traffic volumes without connection management overhead."}], "statistics": {}, "temporal_info": {}, "geographical_data": {}, "references": []}
