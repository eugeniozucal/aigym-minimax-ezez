# Login Testing Report for https://2orpt9ufysuc.space.minimax.io

## Executive Summary

During the comprehensive testing of the login functionality at https://2orpt9ufysuc.space.minimax.io, I encountered a persistent authentication session that prevented access to the actual login form. Despite multiple attempts to clear browser storage and reset the session, the system maintained an active authentication state for a user without admin privileges.

## Testing Methodology

1. **Initial Navigation**: Accessed the target URL
2. **Session Clearing Attempts**: 
   - Hard browser refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
   - Attempted logout via `/logout` endpoint
   - URL parameters (`?fresh=true&clear_session=1`)
   - Manual localStorage and sessionStorage clearing via JavaScript console
3. **Login Form Search**: Attempted to locate login forms through various routes
4. **Network Monitoring**: Monitored console logs for authentication processes

## Key Findings

### 1. Persistent Authentication Session
- **User ID**: `6dd37147-d828-4b40-ae6f-9ebde5a2b1bc`
- **Status**: Authenticated but "Not Admin"
- **Session Persistence**: Survives community-side storage clearing attempts
- **Server-side Session**: Likely maintained through HTTP-only cookies or server-side session management

### 2. Authentication Flow Analysis (from Console Logs)
```
Auth state change: SIGNED_IN 6dd37147-d828-4b40-ae6f-9ebde5a2b1bc
üîÑ Processing auth state change: [object Object]

üîç Fetching admin data for user: 6dd37147-d828-4b40-ae6f-9ebde5a2b1bc
üîí Checking admin access: [object Object]
‚ùå Access denied - user is not an admin
```

### 3. URL Behavior
- **Root URL** (`/`): Redirects to access denied page
- **Login URL** (`/login`): Redirects to dashboard/access denied
- **Logout URL** (`/logout`): Shows authentication verification, then returns to access denied
- **Dashboard URL** (`/dashboard`): Shows access denied page

### 4. Page States Encountered
- **Access Denied Page**: Consistent display across all routes
- **Authentication Verification**: Loading screens during navigation
- **No Login Form**: Unable to access actual login interface

## Screenshots Captured
1. `initial_page_state.png` - Initial access denied page
2. `login_page.png` - Attempted login page access
3. `actual_login_page.png` - Login URL redirect result
4. `logout_page.png` - Logout attempt result
5. `after_storage_clear.png` - Post-storage clearing state
6. `return_to_login_click.png` - Result after clicking "Return to Login"

## Unable to Test Provided Credentials

**Credentials to Test**: 
- Username: `xcliohxy@minimax.com`
- Password: `nUm7nlJ7FD`

**Result**: Could not access login form to test these credentials due to persistent session state.

## Technical Issues Identified

### 1. Session Management
- Server-side session appears to override community-side clearing attempts
- No apparent logout functionality working properly
- Session persists across different URL routes

### 2. Access Control
- Current authenticated user lacks admin privileges
- Application requires admin status for dashboard access
- No clear path to logout or re-authenticate

### 3. Navigation Issues
- "Return to Login" button doesn't navigate to login form
- All routes redirect to the same access denied page
- Authentication verification loops back to access denied state

## Recommendations

### For Testing
1. **Access from Different Browser/Incognito**: Test from a completely fresh browser session
2. **Server-side Session Reset**: May require server-side intervention to clear the persistent session
3. **Alternative Entry Points**: Look for alternative login endpoints or subdirectories
4. **Direct Cookie Manipulation**: Use browser developer tools to manually delete HTTP-only cookies

### For Development
1. **Implement Proper Logout**: Ensure logout functionality properly clears server-side sessions
2. **Session Timeout**: Implement session timeout mechanisms
3. **Login Form Accessibility**: Ensure login forms are accessible even with active sessions
4. **Admin Status Flow**: Provide clear paths for non-admin users to either elevate privileges or logout

## Network Requests Analysis

The authentication system shows:
- Automatic sign-in detection
- Admin privilege checking
- Access denial based on insufficient permissions
- No network requests for credential submission (form not accessible)

## Conclusion

The testing revealed a robust authentication system with persistent session management. However, the inability to access the login form prevents testing of the provided credentials. The system appears to be functioning as designed for access control, but lacks proper session reset capabilities for testing purposes.

- Screenshots documenting each testing phase
- Console log analysis of authentication flow

**Status**: Unable to complete credential testing due to persistent session preventing access to login form.
**Next Steps**: Require fresh browser session or server-side session reset to proceed with credential testing.
