**CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND:** The Phase 6 student learning journey features are currently non-functional due to backend API failures. The learning path API is returning HTTP 500 errors, preventing core functionality from working.

## Test Results Overview

| Feature | Status | Issues Found |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| Learning Dashboard | ✅ Accessible | Empty state due to API failures |
| Course Catalog | ❌ Non-functional | Empty catalog, API errors |
| Learning Path Progression | ❌ Cannot test | Backend API failures |
| Progress Tracker | ⚠️ Limited | No data to track due to API issues |
| Integration with WODs | ❌ Access denied | Requires admin permissions |

## Detailed Test Results

### 1. Learning Dashboard ✅
**Status:** Accessible but limited functionality

### 5. Training Zone Integration ❌
**Status:** Access denied

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Fix Backend API:** Resolve the HTTP 500 error in `learning-path-api/user-learning-path`
2. **Populate Course Catalog:** Add courses to the catalog for testing
3. **Review Access Control:** Clarify admin vs. regular user permissions for Training Zone
4. **Fix Navigation:** Resolve Training Zone and Content dropdown issues

### Testing Priorities
1. Backend API stability
2. Course catalog population
3. Learning path functionality
4. Progress tracking with actual data
5. WOD integration testing (once access resolved)

## Conclusion

The Phase 6 student learning journey features show promise in terms of UI design and structure, but are currently blocked by critical backend issues. The learning path API failure prevents any meaningful testing of the core learning journey functionality. **Immediate backend fixes are required before comprehensive Phase 6 testing can continue.**
