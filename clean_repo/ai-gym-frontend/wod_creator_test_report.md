- **Admin Status: Not Admin** (confirmed by system)

❌ **Admin Privileges**: User does not have administrative access rights

### Access Attempts
1. **Dashboard Access**: ✅ Successful (basic user dashboard available)
2. **Settings Access**: ❌ Access Denied - "You don't have permission to access this page"
3. **Training Zone Access**: ❌ Access Denied - "You don't have permission to access this page"

## Conclusion

**Test Status**: ❌ **UNABLE TO COMPLETE**

**Reason**: The provided user account (`bgolwfan@minimax.com`) does not have the required admin privileges to access the Training Zone where the WOD creator functionality is located.

## Recommendations

1. **Verify Admin Credentials**: Confirm that the provided email/password combination should have admin access
2. **Check User Permissions**: Review the user account settings in the admin panel to ensure proper role assignment
3. **Alternative Testing Account**: Obtain credentials for an account with verified admin privileges
4. **Permission Escalation**: Grant admin privileges to the existing account if intended for testing

## Technical Notes

- The authentication system is functioning correctly
- Role-based access control is properly implemented and enforcing restrictions
- The Training Zone appears to be protected behind admin-only access
- No WOD creator interface could be accessed due to permission restrictions

**Next Steps**: Obtain proper admin credentials to complete the WOD creator functionality testing.
