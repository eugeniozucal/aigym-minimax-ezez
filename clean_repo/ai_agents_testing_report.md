# AI Agents Testing Report - MiniMax Platform

## Test Overview
**Date:** August 26, 2025  
**Target URL:** https://00kv9yxsme23.space.minimax.io/content/ai-agents  
**Objective:** Test access to AI agents to verify if the original AI sandbox is working

## Test Results

### Access Status: **FAILED - Access Denied**

### Detailed Findings

#### Main Platform Page (https://00kv9yxsme23.space.minimax.io/)
- **Platform Title:** AI Gym Platform - Phase 3 Content Management Complete
- **Status:** Access Denied
- **Error Message:** "You don't have permission to access this page"
- **Created By:** MiniMax Agent (indicated in page footer)

#### AI Agents Page (https://00kv9yxsme23.space.minimax.io/content/ai-agents)
- **Status:** Access Denied
- **Error Message:** "You don't have permission to access this page"
- **Page State:** Loading spinner visible, but underlying content shows access restriction

### Technical Observations

1. **Authentication Required:** Both the main platform and AI agents section require proper authentication/authorization
2. **Platform State:** The platform appears to be operational (Phase 3 Content Management Complete), but access is restricted
3. **No Public Access:** No login forms, registration options, or alternative access methods are visible
4. **MiniMax Branding:** Platform is clearly identified as being created by MiniMax Agent

### Visual Evidence

- Content extracted: `ai_gym_platform_access_denied.json`

## Conclusion

The AI sandbox platform is technically operational (as evidenced by the working URL and proper error handling), but **cannot be tested** due to access restrictions. The original AI sandbox appears to be **protected by authentication requirements**.

### Recommendations

1. **Obtain Access Credentials:** Contact the platform administrator for proper login credentials
2. **Check Alternative URLs:** Test if there are public demo endpoints or different access paths
3. **Verify User Permissions:** Ensure the testing account has the necessary permissions to access AI agents
4. **Platform Status Check:** Confirm if the platform is intended for public access or requires special authorization

### Next Steps

To properly test the AI agents functionality, access credentials or permissions would need to be obtained from the platform administrators.
