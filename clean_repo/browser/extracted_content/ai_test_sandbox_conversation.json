  "summary": "The AI Test Sandbox section displays a simulated conversation with an AI agent. The conversation consists of three user queries and three corresponding AI responses. The AI responses are uniform, indicating that they are simulated responses designed to show that the AI would follow its defined system prompt in a production environment, rather than generating a unique response each time.",
  "key_points": [
    "User Message: Hello, can you introduce yourself?",
    "AI Response: I understand you're asking about \"Hello, can you introduce yourself?...\". Based on the system prompt you've defined (\"You are QA Test Agent, a helpful assistant created to test the AI Agents functionality in the Phase ...\"), I should respond according to those specific instructions and personality traits. [This is a simulated response - in production, this would be generated by a real AI model following your exact system prompt. The AI would maintain the personality, knowledge scope, and response style you've defined.]",
