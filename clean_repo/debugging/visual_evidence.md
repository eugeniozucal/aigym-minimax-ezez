This document provides visual evidence of the loading issues encountered with the AI Gym Platform.

## Homepage Loading State

*The application's main page shows a continuous loading spinner without ever rendering content.*

## Login Redirect Behavior

*When navigating to /login, the application redirects to /dashboard but still displays a loading spinner.*

## Dashboard Loading State

*The dashboard page also remains in a perpetual loading state with the same spinner.*

## Key Observations

1. All pages display the same loading spinner without ever rendering actual content
2. No visible error messages are displayed on the user interface
3. The application appears to be handling route changes (redirection from /login to /dashboard) but fails to render the corresponding views
4. The UI is limited to a pink background, loading spinner, and the "Created by MiniMax Agent" widget
