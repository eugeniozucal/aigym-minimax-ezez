npm run build:analyze  # Bundle analysis
```

#### Emergency Development Procedures
If you encounter any crisis symptoms (infinite loops, authentication failures, database errors):

1. **Immediate Stabilization** (< 5 minutes)
   ```bash
   # Stop development server
   Ctrl+C
   
   # Switch to stable commit
   git checkout b3b71bd
   npm run dev
   
   # Verify system works in stable state
   ```

2. **Issue Documentation** (< 10 minutes)
   - Screenshot any error messages or console output
   - Note exact steps that led to the issue
   - Identify what code changes may have caused the problem
   - Check if issue exists in stable commit

3. **Recovery Process** (< 30 minutes)
   - Review crisis recovery lessons for similar patterns
   - Apply appropriate fixes based on documented solutions
   - Test thoroughly before continuing development
   - Escalate to tech lead if issue persists beyond 30 minutes

## 🛡️ Crisis Recovery: Critical Lessons & Prevention Framework

> **⚠️ MANDATORY REVIEW**: This section documents catastrophic system failures that rendered a fully functional platform completely unusable. These lessons are **NOT optional guidelines** but **mandatory requirements** for all development work.

### 🚨 Critical Failure Patterns - Never Repeat These Mistakes

#### 1. Dual System Architecture Conflicts (CATASTROPHIC)
**What Happened**: Phase 4 introduced competing authentication architectures while existing system used custom auth, creating irreconcilable conflicts that broke 100% of user functionality.

**Fatal Patterns to Avoid**:
- ❌ **Never introduce competing architectures** without complete migration strategy
- ❌ **Never create parallel implementations** (e.g., `conversations` + `agent_conversations` tables)
- ❌ **Never mix auth patterns** (Supabase `auth.users` + custom `users` table foreign keys)
- ❌ **Never assume system compatibility** without comprehensive integration testing

**Prevention Requirements**:
```typescript
// ✅ REQUIRED: Single source of truth validation before any auth changes
interface AuthSystemValidation {
  currentSystem: 'supabase_auth_users' | 'custom_users';
  proposedChanges: AuthChange[];
  migrationStrategy: MigrationPlan;
  rollbackProcedure: RollbackPlan;
}
```

#### 2. Authentication State Management Failures (SYSTEM BREAKING)
**What Happened**: `JSON.stringify()` user comparisons and missing JWT validation caused infinite loops and permanent loading states that left users unable to access any functionality.

**Fatal Patterns to Avoid**:
- ❌ **Never use `JSON.stringify()` for user object comparisons** (unreliable)
- ❌ **Never omit JWT `sub` claim validation** (causes 403 errors with no recovery)
- ❌ **Never create authentication state traps** (`user && admin === null` with no timeout)
- ❌ **Never mix RLS policy patterns** (`auth.uid()` vs custom references)

**Required Implementation**:
```typescript
// ✅ MANDATORY: Stable user comparison implementation
const usersAreEqual = (userA: User | null, userB: User | null): boolean => {
  if (!userA && !userB) return true;
  if (!userA || !userB) return false;
  return userA.id === userB.id && userA.email === userB.email;
};

// ✅ MANDATORY: Loading timeout implementation
const [timeoutReached, setTimeoutReached] = useState(false);
useEffect(() => {
  const timeout = setTimeout(() => setTimeoutReached(true), 10000);
  return () => clearTimeout(timeout);
}, []);
```

#### 3. Frontend Component Deadlock Patterns (INFINITE LOOPS)
**What Happened**: Missing `useEffect` dependencies and unstable object references caused infinite re-render cycles that consumed 100% CPU and made the interface completely unresponsive.

**Fatal Patterns to Avoid**:
- ❌ **Never omit dependencies in `useEffect` callback functions**
- ❌ **Never create filter objects on every render** (triggers infinite API calls)
- ❌ **Never chain multiple concurrent API calls** without coordination
- ❌ **Never forget cleanup functions** in effects with async operations

**Required Implementation**:
```typescript
// ✅ MANDATORY: Stable dependencies with cleanup
const memoizedFilters = useMemo(() => ({
  search: searchTerm,
  category: selectedCategory
}), [searchTerm, selectedCategory]);

useEffect(() => {
  const controller = new AbortController();
  
  fetchData(memoizedFilters, controller.signal)
    .catch(err => {
      if (err.name !== 'AbortError') {
        setError(err.message);
      }
    });
  
  return () => controller.abort();
}, [memoizedFilters]);
```

### 🔍 Critical Warning Signs - Immediate Action Required

**🚨 Authentication Warning Signs** (System failure imminent):
- Console errors: "bad_jwt", "invalid claim: missing sub claim"
- Users stuck on loading screens >10 seconds
- Auth state cycling: loading → loaded → loading continuously
- Admin verification returning `undefined` user IDs

**🚨 Frontend Performance Warnings** (Infinite loops active):
- Components re-rendering >10 times per second
- `useEffect` hooks firing continuously in DevTools
- Memory usage increasing during normal operation
- Loading spinners never resolving after timeout

**🚨 Database Integration Warnings** (Data integrity compromised):
- Multiple "fix" migrations for same issue
- Foreign key constraints failing on working features
- RLS policies returning empty results for authenticated users
- User ID format mismatches between tables

### 🆘 Emergency Recovery Procedures

#### Immediate Stabilization (First 2 Hours - Critical)
```bash
# 1. STOP ALL DEVELOPMENT - Focus entirely on recovery
git add . && git commit -m "WIP: Pre-recovery checkpoint"

# 2. SWITCH TO KNOWN STABLE VERSION
git checkout b3b71bd  # Known working commit
npm install
npm run build

# 3. VERIFY BASIC FUNCTIONALITY
npm run dev
# Test: Login → Dashboard → Content → Logout

# 4. DOCUMENT FAILURE STATE (Critical for analysis)
# Screenshot all errors, capture browser console logs
# Note exact sequence of actions that triggered failure
```

#### Database Emergency Recovery (Hours 2-8)
```sql
-- ⚠️ EMERGENCY ROLLBACK TEMPLATE
-- Only use when database conflicts prevent system recovery

-- 1. Backup current state
CREATE TABLE emergency_backup_[timestamp] AS 
SELECT * FROM [affected_table];

-- 2. Remove conflicting elements
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS [conflicting_new_table] CASCADE;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS [conflicting_policy] ON [table_name];

-- 3. Restore consistent RLS pattern
-- Ensure ALL policies use same auth pattern (either auth.uid() OR custom)

-- 4. Test basic operations
SELECT id, email FROM auth.users LIMIT 1;
SELECT id, name FROM [your_main_table] LIMIT 1;
```

#### Frontend Emergency Fixes (Hours 8-24)
```typescript
// 🚨 CRITICAL AUTHCONTEXT FIX PATTERN
// Replace any JSON.stringify comparisons immediately

// ❌ NEVER DO THIS (causes infinite loops):
// useEffect(() => {
//   if (JSON.stringify(user) !== JSON.stringify(prevUser)) {
//     // This causes infinite re-renders
//   }
// }, [user]);

// ✅ EMERGENCY FIX PATTERN:
const authContextValue = useMemo(() => ({
  user: authUser,
  isAuthenticated: Boolean(authUser),
  loading: authLoading,
  // Only include primitive values or stable object references
}), [authUser?.id, authUser?.email, authLoading]);

// ✅ EMERGENCY TIMEOUT PATTERN:
const [emergencyTimeout, setEmergencyTimeout] = useState(false);
useEffect(() => {
  const timer = setTimeout(() => {
    setEmergencyTimeout(true);
    console.error('EMERGENCY: Component loading timeout reached');
  }, 15000); // 15 seconds maximum loading time
  
  return () => clearTimeout(timer);
}, []);
```
