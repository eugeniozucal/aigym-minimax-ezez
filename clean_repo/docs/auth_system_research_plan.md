# AI GYM Authentication System Technical Analysis Plan

**Date:** August 27, 2025  
**Target Application:** https://t4rp9fcdipht.space.minimax.io  
**Objective:** Deep technical analysis of authentication system instability  

## Research Objectives

Conduct comprehensive technical analysis of 8 critical authentication areas:
1. Authentication flow architecture
2. Login/logout implementation  
3. Session management
4. Route protection logic
5. User state management
6. Token handling
7. Root causes of random 'Access Denied' behavior
8. Authentication-related infinite loops

## Known Baseline Issues (from previous report)
- Infinite loading states on dashboard/root pages
- 404 errors on critical routes (/sandbox, /admin, /logout)  
- Authentication backend works but frontend access blocked
- Token management appears functional at backend level

## Analysis Plan

### Phase 1: Architecture Investigation
- [x] 1.1 - Access application and examine network traffic during authentication
- [x] 1.2 - Analyze JavaScript console for authentication flow errors
- [x] 1.3 - Inspect authentication API calls and responses
- [x] 1.4 - Document authentication state management patterns

**Key Findings:**
- Token-based authentication system with automatic refresh
- Successful authentication flow: TOKEN_REFRESHED â†’ SIGNED_IN
- No JavaScript errors in console
- Authentication backend working properly, UI loading issues identified

### Phase 2: Frontend Code Analysis  
- [x] 2.1 - Extract and analyze authentication-related JavaScript code
- [x] 2.2 - Identify route protection mechanisms
- [x] 2.3 - Map user state management implementation
- [x] 2.4 - Analyze session management logic

**Key Findings:**
- React SPA with Supabase authentication system
- JWT validation failure causing 403 "bad_jwt" error with "missing sub claim"
- Admin role-based access control with database table verification
- Protected routes include `/content/automations/*` and `/settings`

### Phase 3: Authentication Flow Testing
- [x] 3.1 - Test login process with monitoring
- [x] 3.2 - Analyze token handling during authentication
- [x] 3.3 - Monitor session lifecycle
- [x] 3.4 - Test logout functionality (if accessible)

**Key Findings:**
- All core authentication routes return 404 errors (/register, /logout, /signin, /profile)
- Login redirects to dashboard but dashboard has infinite loading loop
- No accessible logout functionality
- Session management trapped in infinite loading state

### Phase 4: Issue Root Cause Analysis
- [x] 4.1 - Investigate infinite loading loop causes
- [x] 4.2 - Analyze 'Access Denied' behavior patterns  
- [x] 4.3 - Identify authentication timing issues
- [x] 4.4 - Document system vulnerabilities

**Key Findings:**
- JWT validation failure with "missing sub claim" causing 403 errors
- Authentication initialization code lacks proper error handling
- Infinite loading caused by unhandled authentication errors
- React SPA routing configuration missing critical authentication endpoints

### Phase 5: Technical Documentation
- [x] 5.1 - Compile comprehensive technical findings
- [x] 5.2 - Create system architecture documentation
- [x] 5.3 - Document specific bug patterns and root causes
- [x] 5.4 - Generate final audit report

**Status:** All analysis phases completed successfully. Comprehensive audit report ready for compilation.

## Expected Deliverables
- Complete authentication system architecture documentation
- Root cause analysis of instability issues
- Technical recommendations for fixes
- Detailed audit report in `docs/auth_system_audit.md`

## Success Criteria
- All 8 authentication areas thoroughly analyzed
- Root causes of instability identified
- Technical solutions documented
- Comprehensive audit report completed
