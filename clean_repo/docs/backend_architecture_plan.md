   - [x] Database architecture
   - [x] Supabase enterprise architecture
   - [x] AI GYM comprehensive requirements
   - [x] World-class development practices

2. [x] Get Supabase code examples and best practices
   - [x] Overall Supabase examples
   - [x] Edge Functions examples
   - [x] Database operations
   - [x] Authentication patterns

## Architecture Design Tasks

### 1. Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- [ ] Content Management Service boundary
- [ ] AI Interactions Service boundary  
- [ ] User Management Service boundary
- [ ] Admin Operations Service boundary
- [ ] Define domain models and aggregates
- [ ] Identify bounded contexts

### 2. Clean Architecture Implementation
- [ ] Application layer structure
- [ ] Domain layer with entities and value objects
- [ ] Infrastructure layer with repositories
- [ ] Dependency inversion patterns
- [ ] SOLID principles implementation

### 3. API Design & Specifications
- [ ] RESTful API design
- [ ] API versioning strategy
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Input validation patterns
- [ ] API documentation structure
- [ ] OpenAPI/Swagger specifications

### 4. Edge Functions Architecture
- [ ] Serverless function organization
- [ ] Function deployment patterns
- [ ] Scalability considerations
- [ ] Cold start optimization
- [ ] Resource management

### 5. Integration Patterns
