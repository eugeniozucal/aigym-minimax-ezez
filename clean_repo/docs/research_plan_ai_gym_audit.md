# AI Gym Frontend Save/Load Implementation Audit - Research Plan

## Objective
Perform a comprehensive technical audit of the AI Gym frontend's save/load implementation, identifying architectural flaws, failure points, and technical debt.

## Task Complexity: Complex
This is a complex technical audit requiring deep code analysis, architectural review, and documentation of technical issues.

## Scope of Analysis
1. PageBuilder.tsx save/load logic
2. EnhancedWodsRepository.tsx thumbnail click handlers  
3. CenterCanvas.tsx save button implementation
4. Database API calls and data flow
5. State management issues
6. URL routing problems

## Research Plan

### Phase 1: Initial Code Analysis [COMPLETED]

- [x] Read additional supporting files (types, supabase config, component dependencies)
- [x] Map out component relationships and data flow
- [x] Identify key functions and handlers
- [x] Document current implementation patterns

### Phase 2: PageBuilder.tsx Deep Analysis [COMPLETED]
- [x] Analyze save/load state management
- [x] Review URL parameter handling and routing logic
- [x] Examine data transformation and API integration
- [x] Identify error handling patterns
- [x] Document state synchronization issues

### Phase 3: EnhancedWodsRepository.tsx Analysis [COMPLETED]
- [x] Review thumbnail click handlers and navigation logic
- [x] Analyze filtering and search implementation
- [x] Examine bulk operations and selection state
- [x] Review folder management and content organization
- [x] Identify data fetching and caching patterns

### Phase 4: CenterCanvas.tsx Analysis [COMPLETED]
- [x] Examine save button implementation and user feedback
- [x] Analyze repository selection and configuration
