## Analysis Areas
1. **Current Feature Set and User Journeys** - [x]
   - Extracted existing functionality from Phase 3 baseline (95% production ready)
   - Mapped current user workflows and critical regressions from Phase 4
   - Identified feature gaps and system-breaking issues

2. **Business Requirements Analysis** - [x]
   - AI Sandbox functionality requirements with multi-turn conversation system
   - Content management system needs across 5 repositories
   - User management requirements with RBAC and community organization support

3. **Technical Requirements** - [x]
   - Scalability requirements for 1K-10K concurrent users
   - Performance specifications with response time targets
   - Security requirements addressing authentication conflicts and RLS policies

4. **Integration Requirements** - [x]
   - AI/LLM service integrations with Gemini and multi-model support
   - External service requirements for file processing and analytics
   - API integration patterns and error handling specifications

5. **Admin Panel and Content Creation** - [x]
   - Administrative interface requirements with unified dashboard
   - Content creation workflows with approval and review processes
   - Assignment and distribution system specifications

6. **Conversation History and Multi-turn Chat** - [x]
   - Chat system architecture resolving Phase 4 conflicts
   - Conversation persistence with context management
   - Advanced chat features and organization tools

7. **User Authentication and Authorization** - [x]
   - Authentication mechanisms - unified system addressing dual auth conflicts
   - Authorization frameworks with granular RBAC and RLS policies
   - Security and user experience requirements

8. **Data Management and Storage** - [x]
   - Database requirements with schema consolidation needs
   - Data models addressing current conflicts and integrity issues
   - Storage and backup strategies with security and compliance
