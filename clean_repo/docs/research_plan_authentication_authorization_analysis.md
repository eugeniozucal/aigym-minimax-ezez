# Authentication & Authorization System Analysis Research Plan

## Research Objective
Conduct a detailed analysis of the authentication and authorization system for the AI GYM Platform, examining user authentication, token management, session handling, and access control for Page Builder save operations. Analyze 'Access Denied' issues and identify authentication-related problems.

## Task Complexity
**Complex Task** - Requires comprehensive investigation of system architecture, authentication flows, access control mechanisms, and specific analysis of Page Builder save operations.

## Research Plan

### 1. System Architecture Analysis
- [x] 1.1 Identify authentication provider (Supabase) and configuration
- [x] 1.2 Map authentication components (AuthContext, ProtectedRoute)
- [x] 1.3 Analyze service role key usage in backend functions
- [x] 1.4 Document token flow and session management
- [x] 1.5 Map user roles and permission levels

### 2. Authentication Flow Investigation
- [x] 2.1 Review existing authentication failure reports
- [x] 2.2 Analyze login process and user session creation
- [x] 2.3 Examine token lifecycle and refresh mechanisms
- [x] 2.4 Document authentication state management
- [x] 2.5 Identify authentication timeout and error handling

### 3. Authorization System Analysis
- [x] 3.1 Review role-based access control (RBAC) implementation
- [x] 3.2 Analyze admin vs regular user permissions
- [x] 3.3 Document protected route mechanisms
- [x] 3.4 Examine access control policies in database
- [x] 3.5 Map permission hierarchies and inheritance

### 4. Page Builder Authentication Issues
- [x] 4.1 Review Page Builder save operation code
- [x] 4.2 Analyze authentication requirements for save functions
- [x] 4.3 Identify specific 'Access Denied' error patterns
- [x] 4.4 Document authentication flow for different repositories (WODs, BLOCKS)
- [x] 4.5 Analyze service role vs user token usage in API calls

### 5. Database and Backend Authentication
- [x] 5.1 Review RLS policies for content management tables
- [x] 5.2 Analyze service role key implementation in Edge Functions
- [x] 5.3 Document API authentication patterns
- [x] 5.4 Examine user creation and admin assignment processes
- [x] 5.5 Review audit logging and session tracking

### 6. Error Pattern Analysis
- [x] 6.1 Review historical authentication failure reports
- [x] 6.2 Analyze common 'Access Denied' scenarios
- [x] 6.3 Document authentication timeout patterns
- [x] 6.4 Map error handling and user feedback mechanisms
- [x] 6.5 Identify security-related authentication blocks

### 7. Security Assessment
- [x] 7.1 Evaluate token security and storage
- [x] 7.2 Review session management security
- [x] 7.3 Analyze authentication bypass prevention
- [x] 7.4 Document security best practices implementation
- [x] 7.5 Assess vulnerability patterns

### 8. Recommendations Development
- [x] 8.1 Identify authentication system improvements
- [x] 8.2 Document Page Builder save operation fixes
- [x] 8.3 Propose access control optimizations
- [x] 8.4 Develop troubleshooting guidelines
- [x] 8.5 Create monitoring and alerting recommendations

## Key Focus Areas

### Critical Components Identified
- **Authentication Provider**: Supabase with JWT tokens
- **Frontend Context**: AuthContext.tsx with user/admin state management
- **Protection Layer**: ProtectedRoute.tsx with admin privilege checking
- **API Security**: Service role key usage in Edge Functions
- **Page Builder**: Save operations requiring proper authentication

### Known Issues from Research
1. **Admin-Only Access Model**: Most features require admin privileges
2. **Session Persistence**: Users get stuck in authenticated states
3. **Page Builder Access**: Save operations fail with authentication issues
4. **Token Management**: Potential issues with token refresh and expiration
5. **Access Control**: Over-restrictive policies blocking regular user access

## Expected Deliverables
1. Comprehensive authentication architecture documentation
2. Authorization flow diagrams and explanations
3. Specific Page Builder authentication issue analysis
4. Recommended fixes for 'Access Denied' problems
5. Security assessment and improvement recommendations
6. Implementation guidelines for authentication improvements

## Success Criteria
- Complete understanding of authentication and authorization architecture
- Identification of all authentication-related issues
- Specific recommendations for fixing Page Builder save operations
- Clear documentation of user permission levels and access patterns
- Actionable solutions for improving authentication user experience
