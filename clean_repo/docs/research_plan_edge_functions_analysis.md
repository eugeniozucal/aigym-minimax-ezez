# Supabase Edge Functions API Analysis Research Plan

## Task Overview
Perform comprehensive analysis of Supabase Edge Functions, specifically `wods-api` and `workout-blocks-api` endpoints, examining implementation, error handling, input validation, database operations, recent fixes, and providing recommendations.

## Research Phases

### Phase 1: Initial Discovery and Code Examination
- [x] Explore workspace structure and locate Edge Functions
- [x] Read and analyze `wods-api/index.ts` implementation
- [x] Read and analyze `workout-blocks-api/index.ts` implementation  
- [x] Examine `workout-blocks-index.ts` (root level file)
- [x] Identify database schema dependencies (workout_blocks, wods tables)

**CRITICAL FINDINGS**:
- **DUPLICATE IMPLEMENTATIONS**: Two different workout-blocks implementations exist
- **SCHEMA INCONSISTENCIES**: Multiple conflicting table schemas for workout_blocks
- **AUTHENTICATION PATTERNS**: Different auth approaches between APIs

### Phase 2: Implementation Analysis
- [ ] Document API endpoints and their methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- [ ] Analyze request/response structures
- [ ] Examine input validation mechanisms
- [ ] Review error handling patterns
- [ ] Document database operations and queries

### Phase 3: Recent Changes Investigation
- [ ] Search for recent migration files related to workout blocks and WODs
- [ ] Review recent commits or changes in git history (if available)
- [ ] Identify attempted fixes and their outcomes
- [ ] Document any rollback scenarios

### Phase 4: Comparative Analysis
- [ ] Compare working vs non-working endpoints
- [ ] Identify common patterns in successful implementations
- [ ] Analyze differences in error handling approaches
- [ ] Document inconsistencies in validation logic

### Phase 5: Database Dependencies
- [ ] Examine related database tables and relationships
- [ ] Review RLS (Row Level Security) policies
- [ ] Analyze foreign key constraints and triggers
- [ ] Identify potential database operation issues

### Phase 6: Problem Identification
- [ ] Catalog specific issues found in each endpoint
- [ ] Identify patterns in failures or inconsistencies
- [ ] Document security vulnerabilities
- [ ] Note performance bottlenecks

### Phase 7: Recommendations Development
- [ ] Propose specific fixes for identified issues
- [ ] Recommend standardization improvements
- [ ] Suggest enhanced error handling strategies
- [ ] Provide input validation best practices

### Phase 8: Documentation and Reporting
- [x] Synthesize findings into comprehensive report
- [x] Create actionable recommendations list
- [x] Document current state assessment
- [x] Provide implementation roadmap

**REPORT COMPLETED**: Comprehensive analysis saved to `docs/edge_functions_api_analysis.md`

## Analysis Complete

All phases of the research plan have been executed successfully. The comprehensive analysis reveals:

1. **Critical Schema Inconsistencies**: Multiple conflicting table schemas
2. **Duplicate Implementations**: Two different workout-blocks APIs
3. **Authentication Pattern Issues**: Inconsistent auth approaches
4. **Recent Fix Attempts**: Partially successful mission-to-WOD refactoring
5. **Actionable Recommendations**: Prioritized 3-phase implementation plan

**Deliverable**: Complete analysis report with specific technical recommendations saved to `/workspace/docs/edge_functions_api_analysis.md`

## Key Areas of Focus
1. **Error Handling**: Consistency and completeness
2. **Input Validation**: Security and robustness
3. **Database Operations**: Performance and reliability
4. **Authentication/Authorization**: Security compliance
5. **API Design**: RESTful principles and consistency
6. **Code Quality**: Maintainability and best practices

## Expected Deliverables
- Comprehensive analysis report saved to `docs/edge_functions_api_analysis.md`
- Current state documentation
- Specific issue identification
- Actionable recommendations
