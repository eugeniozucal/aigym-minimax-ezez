# Research Plan: Enterprise Authentication Architecture for AI GYM

## Task Overview
Design a comprehensive enterprise-grade authentication and security architecture for AI GYM using Supabase's auth.users system, resolving the current dual-authentication conflicts and providing a complete enterprise security framework.

## Task Complexity: Complex
This requires in-depth technical analysis, architecture design, and comprehensive documentation with code examples and implementation strategies.

## Research Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Resolve Authentication Crisis**: Design unified authentication system resolving dual-authentication conflicts identified in the crisis analysis
2. **Enterprise RBAC Implementation**: Design comprehensive role-based access control with admin, user, community roles and permissions
3. **Security Architecture**: Comprehensive JWT token handling, RLS policies, MFA, session management
4. **API Security Framework**: Rate limiting strategies, security monitoring, compliance patterns
5. **Migration Strategy**: Detailed plan to migrate from broken current system to unified architecture

### Key Deliverables Required
1. **Technical Specifications**: Detailed authentication flow and security architecture
2. **Database Schemas**: Complete schema design with security policies
3. **Code Examples**: Implementation examples using Supabase best practices
4. **Implementation Roadmap**: Step-by-step migration and deployment plan
5. **Security Compliance**: Enterprise-grade security patterns and monitoring
