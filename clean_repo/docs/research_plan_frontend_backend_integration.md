# Frontend-Backend Integration Analysis Research Plan

## Objective
Analyze the frontend-backend integration between the Page Builder and Supabase Edge Functions, examining API communication patterns, error handling, authentication, and data flow.

## Research Tasks

### Phase 1: Codebase Structure Analysis
- [x] 1.1 Examine frontend architecture (ai-gym-frontend)
- [x] 1.2 Examine backend Supabase Edge Functions structure  
- [x] 1.3 Identify Page Builder components
- [x] 1.4 Map communication pathways

### Phase 2: API Communication Analysis
- [x] 2.1 Analyze API calling mechanisms from frontend
- [x] 2.2 Examine Supabase client configuration
- [x] 2.3 Review request/response handling patterns
- [x] 2.4 Document data serialization/deserialization

### Phase 3: Error Management & Authentication
- [x] 3.1 Analyze error handling strategies
- [x] 3.2 Examine authentication token handling
- [x] 3.3 Review session management
- [x] 3.4 Identify failure points and retry mechanisms

### Phase 4: Page Builder Specific Integration
- [x] 4.1 Analyze Page Builder component interactions
- [x] 4.2 Examine content management API calls
- [x] 4.3 Review real-time data synchronization
- [x] 4.4 Document state management patterns

### Phase 5: Integration Issues & Recommendations
- [x] 5.1 Identify integration bottlenecks
- [x] 5.2 Document communication failures
- [x] 5.3 Analyze performance implications
- [x] 5.4 Provide improvement recommendations

## Expected Deliverables
- [x] Comprehensive integration analysis report
- [x] Current integration patterns documentation
- [x] Issue identification and recommendations
- [x] Best practices for improvement

## Status: COMPLETED âœ…

## Final Summary
Successfully analyzed the frontend-backend integration between the AI Gym Page Builder and Supabase Edge Functions. Key findings include well-structured API communication patterns, robust error handling, and effective authentication mechanisms. Identified opportunities for improvement in caching strategies, real-time synchronization, and request optimization. Complete analysis documented in `/docs/frontend_backend_integration_analysis.md`.
