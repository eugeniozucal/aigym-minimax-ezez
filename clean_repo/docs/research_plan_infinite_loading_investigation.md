# AI GYM Infinite Loading Issues - Technical Investigation Plan

## Research Objective
Conduct a deep technical investigation into infinite loading issues plaguing the AI GYM application to identify exact root causes across all specified areas.

## Investigation Areas
1. React component lifecycle issues
2. useEffect dependency problems  
3. State management infinite loops
4. API call patterns causing deadlocks
5. Loading state management
6. Component re-render cycles
7. Memory leaks
8. Dashboard loading logic

## Task Breakdown

### Phase 1: Codebase Analysis and Structure Understanding
- [x] 1.1 Examine AI GYM platform directory structure
- [x] 1.2 Identify main application components and entry points
- [x] 1.3 Map out routing configuration and page components
- [x] 1.4 Review authentication and context providers

### Phase 2: React Component Lifecycle Investigation  
- [x] 2.1 Analyze main App.tsx component lifecycle
- [x] 2.2 Examine dashboard components for lifecycle issues
- [x] 2.3 Identify components with problematic mount/unmount patterns
- [x] 2.4 Check for constructor/componentDidMount issues in class components

### Phase 3: useEffect Dependency Analysis
- [x] 3.1 Audit all useEffect hooks across the application
- [x] 3.2 Identify missing dependencies in dependency arrays
- [x] 3.3 Find circular dependencies in effect chains
- [x] 3.4 Examine effects that trigger other effects

### Phase 4: State Management Deep Dive
- [x] 4.1 Analyze global state management (Context API, Redux if used)
- [x] 4.2 Identify state updates that trigger infinite re-renders
- [x] 4.3 Examine local component state management patterns
- [x] 4.4 Check for state mutations causing unexpected re-renders

### Phase 5: API Call Pattern Investigation

- [x] 6.2 Identify loading states that never resolve
- [x] 6.3 Examine conditional rendering based on loading states
- [x] 6.4 Check for race conditions in loading state updates

### Phase 7: Component Re-render Cycle Detection
- [x] 7.1 Use React DevTools patterns to identify excessive re-renders
- [x] 7.2 Analyze prop drilling and unnecessary re-render triggers
- [x] 7.3 Examine memoization usage and effectiveness
- [x] 7.4 Identify components causing cascade re-renders

### Phase 8: Memory Leak Investigation
- [x] 8.1 Check for uncleaned event listeners
- [x] 8.2 Identify unresolved promises and async operations
- [x] 8.3 Examine subscription cleanup in useEffect
