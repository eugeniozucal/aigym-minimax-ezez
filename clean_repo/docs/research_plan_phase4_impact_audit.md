# Phase 4 Impact Audit Research Plan

## Objective
Analyze how Phase 4 conversation features broke existing functionality and document exactly what went wrong and why.

## Research Areas

### 1. Database Schema Changes Analysis
- [ ] Examine new conversation tables structure
- [ ] Analyze RLS policy conflicts
- [ ] Review migration files for schema changes
- [ ] Identify foreign key relationships impact

### 2. Authentication System Impact
- [ ] Review auth-related changes in conversation features
- [ ] Analyze RLS policies for new tables
- [ ] Check user permissions conflicts
- [ ] Examine token/session management changes

### 3. Frontend Architecture Analysis
- [ ] Examine conversation history integration
- [ ] Review component architecture changes
- [ ] Analyze state management conflicts
- [ ] Check routing configuration changes

### 4. API Endpoint Impact
- [ ] Review new API endpoints for conversations
- [ ] Analyze modified existing endpoints
- [ ] Check endpoint authentication requirements
- [ ] Examine data flow changes

### 5. State Management Investigation
- [ ] Review context providers changes
- [ ] Analyze conflicts between auth and conversation state
- [ ] Check state synchronization issues
- [ ] Examine hooks modifications

### 6. Component Architecture Impact
- [ ] Review conversation components integration
- [ ] Analyze component dependency changes
- [ ] Check prop drilling or context conflicts
- [ ] Examine component lifecycle issues

### 7. Edge Function Analysis
- [ ] Review edge function modifications
- [ ] Analyze authentication handling in edge functions
- [ ] Check conversation-related function changes
- [ ] Examine error handling modifications

## Expected Deliverables
- Comprehensive analysis document: `docs/phase4_impact_audit.md`
- Detailed breakdown of each broken functionality
- Root cause analysis for each issue
- Technical recommendations for fixes

## Investigation Process
1. Examine codebase structure and recent changes
2. Analyze database schema and migrations
3. Review frontend code for integration issues
4. Test authentication flow conflicts
5. Document findings with evidence
6. Generate comprehensive audit report
