# Research Plan: Phase 5 Comprehensive Functionality Analysis

**Objective:** Extract every detailed explanation provided during Phase 5 iterations and create a complete natural language blueprint document that captures all functionalities without missing anything.

## Phase 1: Information Gathering ✅
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Findings:** 
- Located key source documents:
  - AI GYM - Chapter 5.md (Content Repositories specifications)
  - PHASE_5_ONE_SHOT_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md (Technical implementation plan)
  - WorldClassPageBuilderEditor.tsx (Current implementation)
  - mission_builder_layout_analysis.md (UI layout analysis)
  - phase5_regression_test_report.md (Testing documentation)

## Phase 2: Source Analysis ✅
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Key Information Extracted:**

### From AI GYM Chapter 5:
- [x] Content Engine philosophy ("Master Library" and "Lego Bricks" concepts)
- [x] Unified repository interface design (two-panel layout)
- [x] Product Editor page specifications (two-column layout)
- [x] Specific content type implementations:
  - [x] AI Agents (with test prompt sandbox)
  - [x] Videos (intelligent URL field, transcription)
  - [x] Prompts (copy-to-clipboard functionality)
  - [x] Documents (full WYSIWYG editor)
  - [x] Automations (required tools tagging)
  - [x] Forums (community-specific moderation)
- [x] Content lifecycle and versioning system
- [x] Deletion workflow with safety measures

### From PHASE_5_ONE_SHOT_DEVELOPMENT_PLAN:
- [x] Three-column layout architecture
- [x] Complete block system (12 block types)
- [x] Repository integration system
- [x] BLOCKS section (advanced block management)
- [x] PROGRAMS section (workout programs)
- [x] Preview and publishing system
- [x] Critical bug fixes and implementation details

### From Implementation Files:
- [x] Current WorldClassPageBuilderEditor implementation
- [x] Block creation and management system
- [x] UI state management and interactions
- [x] Save/preview functionality

## Phase 3: Gap Analysis
**Status:** NEEDS COMPLETION
**Missing Information:** 
- Complete conversation history showing Phase 5 evolution
- User's detailed explanations during iterative development
- Specific UI behaviors and interaction patterns not captured in documents
- Conclusive/final version decisions for conflicting implementations

## Phase 4: Comprehensive Documentation Creation
**Status:** READY TO EXECUTE
**Target:** Create PHASE_5_COMPREHENSIVE_FUNCTIONALITY_GUIDE.md with:
- Complete functionality specifications
- Step-by-step workflows
- User interaction patterns
- Technical implementation details
- All UI behaviors and edge cases

## Phase 5: Final Review and Validation
**Status:** PENDING
- Ensure 100% coverage of all explained functionalities
- Verify coherence and resolve any conflicts
- Complete technical accuracy review

**Next Steps:**
1. Request complete conversation history from user if available
2. Begin comprehensive documentation creation based on available information
3. Flag areas requiring additional clarification
4. Complete final validation review
