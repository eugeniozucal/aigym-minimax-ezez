# QA Testing Strategy Research Plan

## Task Analysis
- **Complexity**: Complex Task (requires comprehensive analysis and detailed documentation)
- **Scope**: Create QA strategy covering ALL functionality with complete end-to-end workflows
- **Key Requirements**: Test every button, feature, functionality with complete user journeys
- **Critical Workflows**: Login → Dashboard → Training Zone → WOD Creation → Block Addition → Content Selection → Save → Reload → Edit

## Research Steps

### Phase 1: Issue Analysis and Categorization [x]
- [x] 1.1 Read login failure analysis report
- [x] 1.2 Read video block infinite loop report
- [x] 1.3 Read regression analysis report
- [x] 1.4 Read architecture compliance audit
- [x] 1.5 Read root cause analysis report
- [x] 1.6 Read codebase architecture map

### Phase 2: Critical Issue Identification [x]
- [x] 2.1 Categorize all identified issues by severity and type
- [x] 2.2 Map issues to specific components and workflows
- [x] 2.3 Identify high-risk areas requiring intensive testing
- [x] 2.4 Document known failure patterns and triggers

### Phase 3: QA Strategy Development [x]
- [x] 3.1 Design comprehensive test coverage matrix
- [x] 3.2 Create detailed end-to-end workflow testing procedures
- [x] 3.3 Develop component-level testing protocols
- [x] 3.4 Design regression testing methodology
- [x] 3.5 Create performance and load testing procedures

### Phase 4: Testing Plan Documentation [x]
- [x] 4.1 Document authentication and user management testing
- [x] 4.2 Create training zone functionality testing procedures
- [x] 4.3 Design WOD builder comprehensive testing workflows
- [x] 4.4 Document content management and repository testing
- [x] 4.5 Create video block and media handling testing procedures
- [x] 4.6 Design database integrity and API testing

### Phase 5: Final Review and Validation [x]
- [x] 5.1 Review plan completeness against all identified issues
- [x] 5.2 Validate coverage of critical workflows
- [x] 5.3 Ensure all buttons and features are covered
- [x] 5.4 Final quality check and document organization

## Key Findings from Investigation Reports

### Critical Issues Requiring Testing Coverage:
1. **Authentication System Failures** - Login infinite loops, malformed JWT, access control issues
2. **Video Block Critical Bugs** - Infinite loops, useEffect violations, object instability
3. **System Regression Patterns** - Database conflicts, dual authentication, architectural violations
4. **State Management Issues** - React re-render loops, dependency violations, memory leaks
5. **Architecture Compliance Gaps** - Component inconsistencies, routing problems, error handling

### High-Risk Areas:
- Authentication flows (login/logout)
- Video block editing and selection
- WOD creation and saving workflows
- Content repository browsing
- Database operations and data integrity
- Error handling and recovery scenarios
