# Research Plan: React Save/Load Workflows Best Practices

## Task Overview
Research comprehensive industry best practices for save/load workflows in React applications, covering 5 key areas:
1. State management patterns for persistent data
2. API design patterns for save/load operations  
3. Error handling and user feedback strategies
4. Database schema design for content management
5. URL routing strategies for edit vs view modes

## Research Methodology
- Search for authoritative sources on React development patterns
- Analyze official documentation and best practices guides
- Review industry-standard libraries and frameworks
- Examine real-world implementation examples
- Synthesize findings into comprehensive best practices guide
