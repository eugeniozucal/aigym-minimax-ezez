# AI Gym Save/Load Architecture Design - Research Plan

## Objective
Design a completely new save/load architecture for the AI Gym application that addresses all identified problems in the current implementation while following industry best practices.

## Research Task Type
**Verification-Focused Task**: Focus on depth and quality of verification for architectural patterns and implementation strategies.

## Research Plan

### Phase 1: Problem Analysis ✓
- [x] Analyze current implementation audit findings
- [x] Identify critical architectural flaws
- [x] Document specific failure points

### Phase 2: Best Practices Research ✓ 
- [x] Review React save/load best practices
- [x] Analyze modern state management patterns
- [x] Study API design principles
- [x] Examine error handling strategies

### Phase 3: Architecture Pattern Research ✓
- [x] Study successful page builder architectures
- [x] Analyze component-based design patterns
- [x] Review database schema designs
- [x] Examine real-time collaboration patterns

### Phase 4: New Architecture Design ✓
- [x] Define new database schema with proper relationships
- [x] Design modern state management architecture
- [x] Create API design with error handling and optimistic updates
- [x] Design component architecture and data flow
- [x] Plan URL routing strategy
- [x] Design auto-save implementation with debouncing
- [x] Create independent testing strategy

### Phase 5: Documentation ✓
- [x] Write comprehensive technical specifications
- [x] Include implementation examples
- [x] Document migration strategy

## Key Problems to Address
1. **State Management Chaos**: 9+ scattered state variables
2. **URL Parameter Dependency Hell**: No validation, silent fallbacks
3. **API Integration Anti-Patterns**: Direct Supabase calls, inconsistent error handling
4. **Component Architecture Issues**: Tight coupling, mixed concerns
5. **Performance Issues**: Unnecessary re-renders, race conditions
6. **Security Gaps**: No input validation, inline authentication

## Success Criteria
- Centralized state management with single source of truth
- Robust error handling and user feedback
- Type-safe API integration layer
- Clean component separation of concerns
- Optimistic updates with rollback capability
- Comprehensive testing strategy
