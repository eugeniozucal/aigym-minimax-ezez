# Supabase Database Analysis Research Plan

## Objective
Perform a comprehensive analysis of the Supabase database configuration, focusing on `wods` and `workout_blocks` tables, their relationships, RLS policies, Edge Functions, and identify potential issues causing 'non-2xx status code' errors.

## Research Tasks

### 1. Database Schema Analysis
- [x] 1.1 Examine `wods` table schema and constraints
- [x] 1.2 Examine `workout_blocks` table schema and constraints  
- [x] 1.3 Analyze table relationships and foreign keys
- [x] 1.4 Review indexes and performance optimizations
- [x] 1.5 Examine related tables that interact with wods/workout_blocks

### 2. Row Level Security (RLS) Analysis
- [x] 2.1 Review RLS policies for `wods` table
- [x] 2.2 Review RLS policies for `workout_blocks` table
