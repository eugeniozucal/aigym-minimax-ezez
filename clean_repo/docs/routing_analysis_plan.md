# AI GYM Routing and Navigation Analysis Plan

## Objective
Perform comprehensive analysis of the AI GYM routing and navigation system to identify issues, document architecture, and provide solutions.

## Investigation Areas
1. **Route Configuration and Definitions**
   - [x] 1.1 Frontend routing setup (React Router configuration)
   - [x] 1.2 Backend routing definitions (API endpoints)
   - [x] 1.3 Route mapping and structure analysis
   - [x] 1.4 Dynamic route handling

2. **404 Error Investigation**
   - [x] 2.1 Analyze /sandbox route configuration
   - [x] 2.2 Analyze /admin route configuration  
   - [x] 2.3 Analyze /logout route configuration
   - [x] 2.4 Identify root causes of 404 errors

3. **Navigation Component Implementation**
   - [x] 3.1 Navigation component structure and logic
   - [x] 3.2 Link generation and handling
   - [x] 3.3 Active state management
   - [x] 3.4 Responsive navigation behavior

4. **Route Protection Mechanisms**
   - [x] 4.1 Authentication route guards
   - [x] 4.2 Authorization checks
   - [x] 4.3 Protected route implementation
   - [x] 4.4 Redirect logic for unauthorized access

5. **URL Handling Logic**
   - [x] 5.1 URL parsing and parameter extraction
   - [x] 5.2 Query parameter handling
   - [x] 5.3 Hash routing vs browser routing
   - [x] 5.4 URL construction and validation

6. **Frontend vs Backend Routing Conflicts**
   - [x] 6.1 Client-side routing configuration
   - [x] 6.2 Server-side routing setup
   - [x] 6.3 Conflict identification and resolution
   - [x] 6.4 Fallback mechanisms

## Deliverables
- [x] Complete routing architecture documentation
- [x] Broken routes identification and analysis
- [x] Recommendations for fixes
- [x] Final audit report in `docs/routing_audit.md`
