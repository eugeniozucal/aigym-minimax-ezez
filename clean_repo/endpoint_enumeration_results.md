# Endpoint Enumeration Results - AI GYM Platform

**Target URL:** `https://if4yb5jxn92w.space.minimax.io`  
**Date:** September 15, 2025  
**Testing Type:** Route/Endpoint Discovery  

## Executive Summary

I systematically tested 12 common web application routes to discover accessible endpoints and resources. The results show a highly restricted application with most routes either returning "Page Not Found" errors or redirecting to the login page, indicating authentication requirements.

## Route Testing Results

### ‚ùå Routes Returning "Page Not Found" (404 Errors)

The following routes returned custom "Page Not Found" error pages:

1. **`/api`** - Custom 404 page
2. **`/documentation`** - Custom 404 page  
3. **`/swagger`** - Custom 404 page
4. **`/openapi`** - Custom 404 page
5. **`/health`** - Custom 404 page
6. **`/version`** - Custom 404 page
7. **`/manifest`** - Custom 404 page
8. **`/public`** - Custom 404 page
9. **`/static`** - Custom 404 page

### üîí Routes Requiring Authentication (Redirects to Login)

The following routes redirected to the login page (`/login`), suggesting they exist but require authentication:

1. **`/api/docs`** - Redirected to login page
2. **`/status`** - Redirected to login page  
3. **`/robots.txt`** - Redirected to login page

### üö´ Routes with Standard 404 Response

1. **`/sitemap.xml`** - Returned a different 404 page format with "Page Not Found" and "Go Back" link

## Key Findings

### Application Security Posture
- **Highly Restricted Access**: Most common administrative and API endpoints are either non-existent or require authentication
- **Consistent Error Handling**: The application uses custom "Page Not Found" pages created by "MiniMax Agent"
- **Authentication-Protected Resources**: Several potentially sensitive routes (`/api/docs`, `/status`, `/robots.txt`) redirect to login, indicating they may contain valuable information if accessed with valid credentials

### Notable Behaviors
- **Custom 404 Pages**: Most non-existent routes return custom 404 pages rather than standard server errors
- **Login Redirects**: Three routes suggest protected content by redirecting to authentication
- **Consistent Branding**: All error pages maintain "AI GYM Training Zone Access Portal" branding and "Created by MiniMax Agent" attribution

### Security Implications
1. **Hidden Functionality**: Routes that redirect to login (`/api/docs`, `/status`) likely contain useful information for authenticated users
2. **No Information Disclosure**: The application doesn't reveal internal structure through error messages
3. **Standard Security Practice**: The lack of accessible endpoints without authentication follows security best practices

## Screenshots Captured

- `api_route_test.png` - Shows the custom 404 page for `/api` route
- `api_docs_route_test.png` - Shows the login page redirect from `/api/docs`
- `documentation_route_test.png` - Shows the custom 404 page for `/documentation` route

## Recommendations for Further Investigation

1. **Authenticated Testing**: If valid credentials become available, test the redirected routes (`/api/docs`, `/status`, `/robots.txt`) to discover their actual content
2. **Subdirectory Enumeration**: Test deeper paths like `/api/v1/`, `/api/users/`, `/admin/` etc.
3. **File Extension Testing**: Try different file extensions for discovered routes (e.g., `/api.json`, `/status.xml`)
4. **HTTP Method Testing**: Test different HTTP methods (POST, PUT, DELETE) on discovered endpoints

## Technical Notes

- All tested routes responded quickly without timeouts
- The application appears to be consistently maintained with uniform error handling
- No server information was disclosed through error pages
- The login redirection mechanism appears to be working as intended for protected resources
