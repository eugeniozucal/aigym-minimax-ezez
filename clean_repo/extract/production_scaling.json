Define granular access policies using `auth.uid()`. Use `supabase.auth.getUser()` on the client to drive conditional logic. RLS prevents unauthorized access even with a valid JWT. Example: `CREATE POLICY \"Users can access their own data\" ON profiles FOR SELECT USING (id = auth.uid());`"}, {"category": "Security", "name": "API Keys and Auth Tokens", "description": "Never expose `service_role` keys on the frontend. Use short-lived JWTs and refresh them regularly. Rotate keys periodically and revoke them when compromised."}, {"category": "Performance & Scalability", "name": "PostgreSQL Optimization", "description": "Index frequently queried columns. Use connection pooling (Supabase hosts manage this). Monitor slow queries using `pg_stat_statements`. Normalize data where needed, but denormalize when reads dominate writes."}, {"category": "Performance & Scalability", "name": "Real-Time Features Control", "description": "Enable real-time only on necessary tables. Disable `UPDATE` and `DELETE` events if only `INSERT` notifications are needed. Batch or debounce client updates to reduce UI re-rendering. Use real-time only where latency matters."}, {"category": "Performance & Scalability", "name": "Supabase Edge Functions", "description": "Keep functions short and stateless (under 1s execution).

Test your recovery process."}, {"category": "Observability", "name": "Monitoring", "description": "Enable `pg_stat_statements` to track slow queries.
