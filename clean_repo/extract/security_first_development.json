{"extracted_information": "The provided web content details 'Security-First Development,' emphasizing it as a top priority from the beginning of any software project, guiding every decision throughout the development process. It's presented as an approach to identify and solve security issues early, making fixes significantly cheaper and less time-consuming. This approach is underpinned by 'DevSecOps,' which integrates development, security, and operations into a unified practice where security is everyone's responsibility and is 'built in from day one' through threat modeling, secure coding, and automated testing.\n\nKey advantages of this security-first approach include significant cost savings (up to 100 times cheaper to fix issues early), simplified compliance through automated checks, enhanced customer trust, and improved system resilience against attacks.\n\nEnterprise security approaches are comprehensively described through an 11-stage 'Security-First Pipeline':\n1.  **Requirements & Planning:** Define security requirements, perform threat modeling and risk assessment, and select secure frameworks.\n2.  **Design:** Apply security design principles (least privilege, defense in depth), plan authentication/authorization, and encryption strategies.\n3.  **Development:** Follow secure coding standards (OWASP, CERT), use linters/static analysis, implement dependency management, and scan for CVEs.\n4.  **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Automated code scanning for vulnerabilities, integrated into CI/CD, with build failures on high-severity issues.\n5.  **Build & Integrate:** Secure build environments, code signing, Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) scanning, and pipeline protection.\n6.  **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Test running applications for vulnerabilities and validate security controls.\n7.  **Software Composition Analysis (SCA):** Continuous scanning of open-source components, monitoring for new vulnerabilities (e.g., GitHub Dependabot), and creating a software bill of materials (SBOM).\n8.  **Security Testing:** Comprehensive testing including penetration testing, fuzz testing, API security testing, and access control validation.\n9.  **Deployment:** Automate secure deployment, apply runtime protection (WAF, container scanning), manage secrets securely, and use encrypted connections.\n10. **Monitoring & Feedback:** Continuous monitoring using SIEM systems, log analysis, RASP tools, and feedback channels to developers.\n11. **Continuous Improvement:** Post-mortems for incidents, security awareness training, process review, and sharing lessons learned.\n\nSecure coding methodologies are integrated throughout, particularly in the Development stage where teams are advised to follow established secure coding standards (OWASP, CERT), use linters and static code analysis, implement dependency management, and regularly scan external libraries for known CVEs.\n\nApplications built with this methodology aim for multiple layers of protection, supply chain security, robust data protection, and a zero-trust approach to withstand attacks.", "specifications": {"security_first_pipeline_stages": ["Requirements & Planning: Define security goals, threat modeling, risk assessment, choose secure development
