### 4. Historical Evidence

**Phase 7 Rollback Report (September 13, 2025):**
- Documents that `ai-gym-platform` was the "original working version"
- Phase 7 implementations created separate applications that broke functionality
- Working version was rolled back from `ai-gym-platform/dist`

**However:**
- The rollback report refers to an older deployment scenario
- Current analysis shows `ai-gym-working-version` has the most comprehensive implementation
- Build timestamps show recent activity on `ai-gym-working-version`

### 5. Build Analysis

**Recent Builds (Sep 16, 2025):**
- `ai-gym-admin-portal/dist`: 19:27 (most recent)
- `ai-gym-working-version/dist`: 19:21
- `ai-gym-platform/dist`: 19:21

**Assessment:**
- Multiple projects have recent builds
- `ai-gym-admin-portal` has most recent build time
- However, build time alone doesn't indicate deployment

### 6. Feature Completeness Comparison

| Feature | ai-gym-working-version | ai-gym-platform | ai-gym-admin-portal |
|---------|----------------------|-----------------|--------------------|
| User Management | ✅ Comprehensive | ✅ Basic | ✅ Admin Only |

## Conclusion

### Primary Identification: `ai-gym-working-version/`

**Reasoning:**
1. **Comprehensive Implementation**: Most extensive feature set matching the expected functionality of a complete learning management system
2. **Content Management Focus**: Sophisticated content management system with multiple editors (AI Agents, Videos, Documents, etc.)
3. **Production Readiness**: Includes error boundaries and production error handling
4. **Architecture Quality**: Well-structured with proper separation of concerns
5. **Recent Activity**: Recent build indicating active development/deployment

### Secondary Candidates:

**ai-gym-platform** (30% probability):
- Historical evidence from rollback report
- Good user-facing features
- Learning management focus
- However, lacks the comprehensive content management seen in working-version

**ai-gym-admin-portal** (10% probability):
- Most recent build timestamp
- Admin-focused features
- However, lacks user-facing functionality expected at /dashboard URL

### Recommendations:

1. **Verify Deployment**: Check build outputs of `ai-gym-working-version/dist` against deployed site
2. **Compare Features**: Test deployed functionality against `ai-gym-working-version` feature set
3. **Check Recent Deployments**: Review any recent deployment logs that might confirm which dist folder was deployed
