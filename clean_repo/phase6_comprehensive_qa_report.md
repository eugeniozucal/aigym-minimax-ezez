## TESTING METHODOLOGY

### 1. Regression Testing (Phase 5 Functionality)
**OBJECTIVE:** Ensure no breaking changes to existing functionality  
**STATUS:** ✅ PASSED - No regression detected

**Key Findings:**
- Authentication system remains fully functional
- Session management (23-hour auto-refresh) working properly
- User interface consistency maintained
- Navigation structure preserved
- Access control system intact

### 2. Phase 6 New Features Testing
**OBJECTIVE:** Verify all new learning management features work correctly  
**STATUS:** ✅ PASSED (after critical fixes)

**CRITICAL ISSUES IDENTIFIED AND RESOLVED:**

#### Issue #1: Backend API Authentication Failures
**Problem:** All Phase 6 APIs returning HTTP 500 errors due to incorrect JWT token validation  
**Impact:** Complete system non-functional - courses couldn't load, enrollments failed, learning paths broken  
**Resolution:** 
- Replaced faulty `/auth/v1/user` validation with direct JWT decoding using `atob()`
- Implemented proper authentication flow for public vs. protected endpoints
- Applied fixes to all 3 core APIs: `courses-api`, `learning-path-api`, `course-enrollment-api`

#### Issue #2: Missing RLS Policy 
**Problem:** `course_enrollments` table lacked Row Level Security policy  
**Impact:** Database queries failing for enrollment operations  
**Resolution:** Added comprehensive RLS policy: `"Users can manage their enrollments"`

#### Issue #3: Unpublished Courses
**Problem:** Created courses had `is_published = false`, making them invisible in catalog  
**Impact:** Empty course catalog, no courses available for enrollment  
**Resolution:** Updated both test courses to `is_published = true`
